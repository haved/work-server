        <h1> Haved's work server </h1>
        Hi, and welcome to my work server. You seem to be human, why are you here?
        This server is for handeling work, such as compiling latex from git.
        It isn't really meant for humans to just look at, so very few GET requests are handled here.
        <br>
        ~~Goodbye~~
